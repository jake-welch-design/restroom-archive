An archive of public restrooms 

Beginning at the beginning of 2023, I thought it would be funny to 3D scan a public restroom using the app Polycam. However, the more restrooms I scanned, the more I appreciated their chaotic nature as some of the few private unmonitored public spaces. From neglected truck stops to restrooms at Disnelyand & Yellowstone National park, this in-progress archive aims to capture these bizarre spaces & all of their artifacts. 

The 3D viewing tool was developed using p5.js.
